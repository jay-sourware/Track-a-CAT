# On Vehicle Device Team Summary
This is an initial synopsis of how The On Vehicle Device Team will approach the onboard device tracking system.

### Hardware & Cost

Arduino board (≈$18)<br />
GPRS shield (≈$32)<br />
GPS board (≈$40)<br />
Case for Arduino board (≈$8)<br />
SIM card with data plan (≈$45 / month)


### Arduino Board

Pros
- Cost effective
- Extremely customizable
- Automatically boots to the default program
- Runs on 12v power
- Not susceptible to attacks<br />

Cons
- Not many

### Initial Discussion Conclusion
Initial device type options<br />
**Arduino Board**

How best to collect location from the device<br />
**GPS module from the Arduino Board**


Transmitting vehicle location to an API as a JSON object<br />
**To be determined**

Estimated per device cost both initial and monthly service feeds if applicable<br />
**$18 - $30 for Arduino Board**<br />
**Cellphone data (≈$45 monthly)**


Supportability and Replacement difficulty of on vehicle device<br />
**Minimum (devices are plug and play)**

Configuration Requirements<br />
**Heat Shield**<br />
**Waterproofing**<br />
**Power Sourcing**<br />
**Wind Protection**

Can the device be automated to require no driver interaction?<br />
**Yes**
